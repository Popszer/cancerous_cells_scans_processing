# Decision making tool for PET scans

## Context

PET imaging is a valuable tool to diagnose and track patients with multiple myelomas (advanced cancers with metastasis). See images below.
The images show lesions as dark regions.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning tools (*e.g.* SVMs or random forests) in order to classify lesions and predict the survival time.

## Tasks

- Bibliographic study
- Implement PET scans processing algorithms in Python to predict survival time
